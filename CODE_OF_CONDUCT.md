# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as a group, agree to follow and maintain university guidlines during our project work.
We will all work equally and fairly as a team to ensure that we produce legitimate work.


## Team Rules

* All contribute to the team project equally
* Ensure that we keep up-to-date with all project work
* If a team member doesn't contribute they will be reported at the next review
* If we have any disagreements we will sort internally where possible before involving lab leaders.

## Our Standards

Copied from a template but we will follow the below:

* Demonstrating kindness toward other people within the group
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within our group project, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the project in the University.
Examples of representing our group would be pitching a proposal to the lecture leader or submitting work on behalf of the group.
